description: "Transportation and ride-sharing company Lyft operates in hundreds of cities, but in Miami we're helping them create an unprecedented community impact. Together, we're helping locals explore and connect with Miami's unique neighborhoods. Each month, we share places to eat, drink, and explore; and cover the people, history, and future of a Miami neighborhood â€” as well as a Lyft activation to help people get there. We design unique events (examples include history happy hours, restaurant crawls, and community conversations) to invite Miamians to explore different parts of the city. The results? Dynamic guides and experiences that our community returns to again and again, and deep engagement for our partner. We create more than 250,000 local engagements each month for Lyft, building new brand equity along the way."
